#My portofolio

##Description
As a new student, I want to make a portofolio so I can showcase my future projects.
I found this challange a bit difficult and I did not manage to apply all the elements that I wanted.
I feel this is a good starting point and as I learn, I will be able to improve it.
In this project so far, I've applied: flexbox, grid layout and a bit of CSS variables.
I've used the a href attribute to add some "jump" links and to add some URLs in the "contact me" section.
I am a bit disappointed was not able to apply media queries yet.
